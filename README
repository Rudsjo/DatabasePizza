BACKEND CONFIGFILE:

To choose the preferred backend, go into the bin folder on the projekt and open Configfile.cfg. After it´s open, move the hashtag
to the backend you don´t want running. The Configfile is created when you run the 
application and defaults to MSSQL database.

Folders Backendhandler and menufunctions are the dll:s for the applications, and holds all the necessary 
functions, classes, interface and repositorys. A dependency is already set so you should only
need to pull all folders and run whichever program you want.
